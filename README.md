# Examples for Short-course on Data Assimilation

In this repository I created a set of **Hello World** examples
to introduce how Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks work and
how you can implement them with PyTorch. 

Information on this course is available at: [couse link](https://www.gov.br/inpe/en/events/short-course-ad/2022)


# Install
These examples store the **example** data using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). 
Please read the instructions on how to use it, if it is already installed in your computer
you can download the test data with `git lfs fetch`.
